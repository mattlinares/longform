Description: # Longform
        
        Provides a new page type in wagtail that allows authors to add content to several newely defined block types within streamfield.
        
        Each longform page created produces both a page that depends on JavaScript, and, a Printable, Accessible, JavaScript-less, lightweight page.
        
        
        ## What's required
        
        * An instance of [Wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail)
        
        
        ## What's included
        
        * Blocktype definitions for streamfield
        * Templates, compiled CSS and JS to render both resulting pages
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        
        
        
        ## Authoring content with it
        
         * The `title`, `introduction` and `background image` make up the Coverblock
         * The `menu links` populate the primary navigation
         * The `related page` is added to the Footerblock as a link using the `title` and `introduction` properties from the linked page
         * Within the `body` an author will need to create a `chapter` providing it with a `title`, each chapter populates the chapter navigation present on desktop resolutions upwards
         * After creating a `chapter` users can then chose the `section` style they would like to use
        
        
        ## Developing with it
        
        If you would like to make modifications to the templates;
        
        * Browse the templates directory and modify the corresponding template
        
        If you would like to adjust the CSS and/or JS;
        
        * Ensure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 4.x or higher (we recommend sticking to LTS releases to ensure module compatibility)
        * Install dependancies, navigate to the `/longform` directory and run `npm install`
        * Build and watch source directories with `npm run dev`
